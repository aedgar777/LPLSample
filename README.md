Sample app that I wrote for the LPL take home assessment. It fetches a JSON list of simple items from a single endpoint, formats/transforms them into a domain Comment object using a Mapper class, and displays them in a ComposeAcitivity (for simplicity. Would typically use Fragments for a multi-screen app). This project makes use of Compose for UI, Retrofit for building API calls, Coroutines for concurrency, and Koin for dependency injection. This project implements the MVVM and respository architectural patterns, with API declarations (CommentApi), their calls (CommentRepository) in separate classes, which would support modularization and easy extendability in a more complex app. Data is fetched in the CommentViewModel via the CommentInteractor that provides access to the aforementioned data sources.

The testing suite is built with Junit and Mockito. Coil is used for rendering the profile picture on comments when it is replaced by the user.
